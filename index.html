            <p>With one small tweak to a 60-year old Public Law…</p>
            <p>The U.S. Department of Treasury has given Americans direct access to a HUGE stream of income.</p>
            <p>One that brings a<strong> </strong>potential <u>$28.8 billion</u><strong> </strong>up for grabs…</p>
            <p>All thanks to the <strong>5G Revolution</strong> that’s sweeping the nation.</p>
            <p>Forbes calls it a <em>Massive Home Run.</em></p>
            <p>And sure enough, Americans from every state are hitting it out of the park…</p>
            <div class="t-section-1">
                <ul class="checkmark">
                    <li><strong>George K</strong>, a retired Air Force captain from Boca Raton, Florida <strong><u>collects $1,233.33 every
                                month</u></strong> on average.<br /></li>
                    <li><strong>Andrea J</strong>, a 54 year-old mother of two children from California collects<strong><u> $1,116.30 </u></strong>

                    <li>The best is <strong>Carl R</strong>, a 66-year-old man from Houston TX, who <strong><u>gets a cool $7,163.25</u></strong> at

                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Because these payouts come multiple times, Carl collects $85,959 per year </p>
            <p>And you know the best part about these 5G payouts? </p>
            <p><u>Anybody can get them. </u></p>
            <p>You can be working, retired, a student (over 18 years), a housewife, collecting social security… it doesn’t matter.
            </p>
            <p>You don’t need any special training… or contacts with influential people or anything of that sort.</p>
            <p>All you will need is a mobile phone or internet connection to get set up.</p>
            <p>Speaking of mobile phones…</p>
            <p>You might already know 5G is the next big leap in mobile telephony</p>
            <p>But there is a lot more to it than just faster and better phones</p>
            <p>In just a moment, I’ll show you how 5G can completely change the way you live…</p>
            <p>Do business…</p>

            <p>But right now, i, you need to know that</p>
            <p>The 5G rollout puts you smack dab in the center of the biggest wealth-creating opportunity since electricity.</p>
            <p>*The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> holds nothing back while describing this opportunity.</p>

            <p><em>Forbes</em> puts it even more bluntly. </p>

            <p>Today, I’m going to show you how you can grab the bull by the horns and collect regular payouts – what I call “<em>5G Cash”</em> – in your name. </p>
            <p>Fact is…</p>
        </div>
        <h2><strong>Thousands of Americans are already collecting “5G Cash”</strong></h2>
        <div class="triangle-down"></div>
        <div class="row small-12 column">
            <p>By the time you finish reading this you will know exactly what to do to get the next round of “5G Cash” which on
                average get distribute once every 19 days </p>
            <p>In fact, the next payout is scheduled for Dec 26.</p>
            <p>Because of their regularity, the payouts can work out to nice lump sum every year.</p>
            <p>For example…</p>
            <p>Kevin L, a health care volunteer from Naples, FL collects $1,689.79 a month on average – or $20,277 every year…</p>
            <p><em>(graphic)</em></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Pamela R, a 65-year-old arts graduate from Boston collects $4,591.41 a month – or over $55,000 a year…</p>
            <p><em>(graphic)</em></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>51-year-old Olivier P, who speaks five languages fluently, collects $6,050.45 every month. In whichever language he
                tells you, it adds up to exactly $72,605 a year. </p>
            <p><em>(graphic)</em></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Of course, these payouts are staggering. </p>
            <p>Yet some folks have taken matters into their own hands, and enjoy even larger payouts…</p>
            <p>Like Joseph R M for example. </p>
            <p>This 55-year-old man who used to work for a childcare support company takes home $112,277.40 a year…</p>
            <p><em>(graphic)</em></p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>And William who prefers not to disclose anything other than his first name collects – get this – $224,373 every
                single year. </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Instead of waiting for high-speed 5G data connections to hit their neighborhood…</p>
            <p>These savvy Americans sniffed out the opportunity hidden in the 5G rollout</p>
            <p>There’s no reason why you cannot do the same. </p>
            <p>Listen, in whichever town or city in America you go, you see people with fancy million dollar homes…</p>

                <p>No, I’m not talking about celebrities, politicians, and rock stars.</p>
                <p>I’m talking about regular Americans like you and me who are enjoying celebrity lifestyles.</p>
                <p>Do you think those people get their wealth from salaried jobs?</p>
                <p>No sir!</p>
                <p>That kind of wealth happens only if you open your door when opportunity knocks. </p>
                <p>And right now, thanks to 5G, opportunity is not only knocking… it is beating down on your door. </p>
                <p>Here’s why.</p>
                <p>If you are like most Americans, you might think 5G is just another smartphone upgrade </p>
                <p>I don’t blame you.</p>
                <p>As mobile phones went from 1G to 2G to 3G to 4G… they either got faster or better or both. </p>

                <p>Like President Trump, Eisenhower was obsessed with Making America Great… starting with an Interstate Highway System.
                </p>
                <p>It was a very ambitious plan… and to fund it, Eisenhower hit upon a brilliant plan…</p>
                <p>Which he got passed through congress and signed into law. </p>
                <img class="image-center shadow width-60" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/LIR/LIR_5GCashTower_0120/Pictures/LIR_5G_PublicLaw.png">
                <p>The law was simply called PL 86-779</p>
                <p>In a nutshell… the law incentivized big corporations to invest in the infrastructure of the country.</p>
                <p>In return, the corporations would get MASSIVE tax breaks…</p>
                <p><strong><em>Plus</em></strong>…</p>
                <p>American people would be incentivized to invest in these corporations </p>
                <p>The way the plan was structured… both the corporations as well as individual Americans end up making pot loads of
                    money.</p>
                <p>In other words, it was a <strong>win-win-win</strong>.</p>
                <ul class="checkmark">
                    <li>America wins.</li>
                    <li>America corporations win</li>
                    <li>Individual Americans win. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Over the years, Eisenhower’s masterplan proved to be runaway success. and… </p>
                <p><u>What started with highways… soon spread into other infrastructure projects. </u></p>
                <p>Take a look at what happened with oil and gas pipelines.</p>
                <p>The United States has more than 2.4 million miles of pipeline.</p>
                <p>At today’s rate, that’s a whopping $19.8 trillion worth of pipelines. </p>
                <p>Raising that kind of money was only possible because large energy companies pitched in (to get the tax breaks).</p>
                <p>And as a part of the Eisenhower law, thousands of Americans who invested in these energy companies got (<strong>and
                        are still getting</strong>) a lions share of the profits. </p>

                <p>While <strong>PL 86-779</strong> was good for infrastructure industries…</p>
                <p>It was <em>not</em> applicable to non-infrastructure businesses like communications. </p>

                <p><strong>You might wonder why you have you not heard about “5G Cash” before.</strong></p>
                <p>There are two reasons why so very few people know of “5G Cash.”</p>
                <p><strong>First,</strong> for some strange reason Public Law 86-779 was hidden in page 998 of a binder, titled Cigar
                    Excise Tax Extension Act.</p>
                <p>To make matters worse, it was included under other purposes.</p>

                <p>As a result, a huge income opportunity just got buried in the pages of history. </p>
                <p><strong>Second</strong>, it’s not advertised anywhere…</p>
                <p>No wonder the editor of Moneypaper says, </p>

                <p>Behind the scenes, these towers hide a <u>MASSIVE secret.</u></p>
                <p>You see, while you and I pay our monthly cell phone bills to the cell phone companies… </p>
                <p><strong><em>The cell phone companies DO NOT actually OWN the towers.</em></strong></p>

                <p>Crazy, right?</p>
                <p>Companies like Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Sprint, pay huge RENT to these wireless towers. </p>
                <p>Now here’s where it get interesting.</p>
                <p>Because these towers are <em>now</em> classified as “infrastructure”, the owners can advantage of the massive tax
                    breaks.</p>
                <p>In return, they are <strong><em>forced</em></strong> to distribute a huge part of the rent.</p>

                <p>That’s just an appetizer.</p>
                <p>Remember, the $28.8 billion is just from the 605,000 towers that that are already up and running.</p>

                <p>Getting started is brain-dead simple.</p>
                <p>All you need to do is fill out the on-line form…</p>
                <p>Decide how much you’d like to receive every month in “5G cash” (a rough estimate will do), and…</p>
                <p>Fill in an address where you’d like the cash delivered.</p>
                <p>Remember, the “5G Cash” you receive will depend entirely on you, how much you opt for, and your willingness to
                    increase the stakes. </p>
                <p>My advice would be to start small for the first 3- 4 months. </p>
                <p>And gradually increase the stakes as you get more comfortable once the “5G Cash” starts rolling in. </p>
                <p>Like…</p>
                <p>53-year-old Robert S gets $296.60 every month</p>
                <p>Grace L, a 59-year-old working mom gets 678.90 every month. That’s enough to look after the grocery and fuel bills.
                </p>
                <p>57-year-old Brian C is pretty pleased with the 356.80 he collects every month in “5G Cash”. He knows it will soon
                    grow bigger. </p>
                <p>Andrew F gets 488.60 every month. </p>
                <p>It all depends how much you want to make. And how big of a claim you want to stake.</p>
                <p>But any way you slice it… </p>
                <p>“5G Cash” will continue to produce BIG income for Americans. </p>
                <p>…And it’s only going to get bigger!</p>
                <p>Remember, the average Social Security check is $1,461</p>
                <p>That’s barely enough to live on.</p>
                <p>But with “5G Cash”, even if you start small, you could soon have a shot at collecting as much as your social security
                    check per month, or more!</p>
                <p>Imagine ending up with two social security checks every month.</p>
                <p>Wouldn’t that be great?</p>
                <p>You could use one for the regular day-to-day expenses.</p>
                <p>And the other for really living it up. </p>

                <p>Of course… over the long your “5G Cash” could be worth a lot more. </p>

                <p>It’s true.</p>
                <p>In fact, the “5G Cash” from one of these tower companies more than tripled in the last 5 years.</p>
                <p>Which means people who were getting $10,000 five years ago are getting more than $30,000 this year… </p>
                <p>That’s TRIPLE the income.</p>
                <p>Without doing a thing. </p>
                <p>The “5G Cash” of another company did even better. </p>
                <p>They quadrupled. </p>
                <p>All because they are bound by law to distribute a pre-set percentage of their profits. </p>
                <p>As the profits go up, so do your payments!</p>
                <p>Gerald A … collects a little over 1,389.35 every month…</p>
                <p>Ronald W… $894.25 a month</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>David L’s monthly income from “5G Cash” now reads $687.40</p>
                <p>Christy L… collects a little over 10,000 every month…</p>
                <p>And when Robert F gets his “5G Cash”, he can’t help but smile at the five-figure amount.</p>
                <p>Because he knows it totals up to a six-figure amount ($143,797) every year.</p>
                <p>Today you could put yourself in a similar position to receive “5G Cash” </p>

                <p>Listen, if you use any American cellphone carrier… </p>
                <p>In a way you already have an unofficial stake in these towers..</p>
                <p>The bills you’ve paid have been indirectly funding the installation and upkeep!</p>
                <p>But instead of getting something in return, all you get is bigger bills.</p>
                <p>It’s just not fair. </p>
                <p>Right?</p>

                <p>As a former hedge fund manager I used to handle multi-million dollar portfolios for the elite.</p>
                <p>An heiress to a “soda” fortune… an oil magnate…elite lawyers…</p>
                <p>These are the kind of folks- the <em>ultra-rich</em>- who I helped get richer.</p>
                <p>I tell you this not to brag, but to let you know I <em>hated</em> it.</p>
                <p>You see, I was not my own boss, which meant I had to do things a certain way…even though I knew there were much
                    better ways of doing them.</p>
                <p>That said, I was learning a lot about different aspects of Wall Street…so I stuck around.</p>
                <p>Once I felt I had all the tools (knowledge) to help regular Americans grow their wealth …</p>
                <p>I quit. </p>
                <p>These days… I live in Georgia Atlanta, where I juggle my time between being a financial analyst for my readers and

                <p>Having seven kids is exciting… but it is expensive.</p>

            <div class="row small-12 column">
                <p>The thing is, having worked as a financial analyst for so many years, my mind is hardwired to sniff out income
                    opportunities.</p>
                <p>In fact, that’s how I discovered ‘5G Cash’. </p>
                <p>Here, let me tell you how I spotted it.</p>
                <p>It all started as I was jogging past a team of technicians working on a cell tower near my house. </p>
                <p>Something about them stuck me as odd. </p>
                <p>I could tell it was a Verizon team because of the logos – on the van, on the technicians jackets, their tool box, the
                    ladder – even the traffic cones around the van had the logos. </p>
                <p>The odd thing was… the tower itself did not have any logo. </p>
                <p>Curious, I did a bit of digging into these cell towers and found out that Verizon did not own the tower.</p>
                <p>A little more digging and I figure... </p>
                <p>Most of these big telcom companies don’t own these towers. </p>
                <p>They just rent them… </p>
                <p>That’s how I discovered the “5G Cash” opportunity so few American know about.</p>
                <p>And today, I’m going to show how you can make the most of it. </p>
                <p>Not only is this a huge income opportunity for you…</p>

                <p>Well, here’s your opportunity to turn the tables and make money off them.</p>
                <p>100% legally.</p>
                <p>Starting with an initial grubstake as little as $135, or even less, you could </p>

                <p>In fact, the more well-off you are today, the more you’ll need the extra income to keep up with your current
                    lifestyle. </p>
                <p>Also you might have heard rumors of Social Security checks being slashed by 23% in the future.</p>

                <p>There are people who are making even more from this opportunity….</p>
                <p>William H is getting 224,373 every year</p>

                <p>In other words, he’s a millionaire in less than two years.</p>
                <p>Of course, these are extraordinary cases and I’m sure their initial investments were big.</p>
                <p>But even if you start small… it slowly builds up.</p>
                <p>Listen you might not become a millionaire in 2 years. But even if 5G Cash help you become one in say, 8 -10 years…

                <p>In this presentation, I’m going to break down how YOU can start collecting “5G Cash”… </p>
                <p>I’ll cover all the important details, in plain English: </p>
                <ul class="new-disc">
                    <li>Where to get information on companies that give out the most “5G Cash”</li>
                    <li>How big your pile of cash could be</li>
                    <li>How many Americans have been collecting “5G Cash” for years</li>
                    <li>How — no matter your age or income —you can 100% take advantage of this situation</li>
                    <li>How this opportunity is 100% legal and open to the public</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And I’ll also share why a recent memo signed by President Trump has turned “5G Cash” into the BEST retirement funding
                    plan I’ve seen in my career!</p>
            </div>
            <h2><strong>$28.8 Billion in “5G Cash”. 28,800 millionaires in the making. And we’re just starting</strong>
            </h2>
            <div class="triangle-down"></div>
            <div class="row small-12 column">
                <p>Fact is…</p>
                <p>Your wireless providers cannot function without these towers.</p>
                <p>So they shell out as much as 25% of their revenues to use these towers.</p>
                <p>Just to give you an idea, in 2018 they shelled out $130 billion in rent. </p>
                <p>And once all the running costs are factored in - the tower companies who collect this rent are left with a whopping
                    profit of around $32 billion. </p>
                <p>Of which they get to keep 10% and distribute 90% as “5G Cash”. </p>
                <p>The math is simple. $32 billion minus $3.2 billion (10%)</p>
                <p>That’s $28.8 Billion.</p>
                <p>That ENTIRE pool of money is up for grabs.</p>
                <p>The smart Americans I mentioned earlier have figured out a way to get their share of the $28.8 billion in the form of
                    “5G Cash”.  </p>
                <ul class="checkmark">
                    <li>George K $1233.33</li>
                    <li> Andrea J $1116.30</li>
                    <li> Craig M $2650.60</li>
                    <li> Carl R $7163.25</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And by implementing the same simple strategy as George, Andrea, Craig and Carl you can collect “5G Cash” every month!
                </p>
                <p>Forbes goes as far as calling it this type of opportunity <strong>“Printing Money”</strong></p>

                <p>The companies that own these 5G towers are now expanding at a pace never seen before.</p>
                <p>In addition to the large towers, they are adding smaller towers (nodes) to keep pace with the growth. </p>
                <p>The graph below shows the growth rate of these smaller nodes. </p>

                <p>The number of cell phones have not even increased by 7%.</p>
                <p>But the cell towers have increased by over 500%.</p>
                <p>All because of 5G</p>
                <p>The rapid growth seen in this graph is just the beginning.</p>
                <p>According to a report made by Google for the DoD (Department of Defense), ideally there should be at least 13 million

                    his Social Security. His wife should be suitably impressed.</p>
                <p>47 year old Brian L is an accountant. So he knows exactly how his “5G Cash” has grown… and will grow. He is currently
                    getting $2018 every month</p>
                <p>Then there is Martin L. </p>
                <p>Now Martin’s is closely involved with these companies… and therefore might have more access to information than
                    ordinary Americans do…</p>
                <p>But still… take a look at what he gets in “5G Cash”. It will help you understand the full potential of what we are
                    talking about. </p>
                <p>Martin gets <strong><u>a whopping $530,851 every year in </u></strong>“5G Cash”. That’s half a million every year. </p>
                <p>Listen, it does not matter how small or big your first “5G Cash” pile is.</p>
                <p>What matters is how soon you get it. Because…</p>
            </div>
            <h2><strong>The faster you get “5G Cash…” the sooner you’ll be able to start growing it.</strong></h2>

            <div class="row small-12 column">
                <p>Take a look at how Robert E. grew his “5G Cash” in just three years</p>

                <p>I’m sure Robert, and all of the Americans collecting “5G Cash” are glad they got started as soon as they did.</p>
                <p>Of course, not all the people collecting “5G Cash” are ordinary Americans like you and me.</p>
                <p>There are some very special people who are quietly collecting thousands of dollars in “5G Cash”.</p><img class="image-right" id="bill" src="https://d13p2xj50zkyqm.cloudfront.net/promos/AF/LIR/LIR_5GCashTower_0120/Pictures/LIR_5G_BillGates.png">
                <p>Bill Gates is one of them.</p>

                <p>Sources close to Bill say his “5G Cash” is easily worth over $1million every month. </p>
                <p>If one of the richest men in the world sees merit in getting “5G Cash”, I’m guessing there’s something to it.</p>
                <p>Bill Gates and Donald Trump may not agree on many things… </p>
                <p>But these titans DO see eye to eye on this particular company</p>

                <p>And in just a few minutes, I’ll tell you how you too can start getting “5G Cash” from this very company for as little $135. </p>
                <p>While I don’t know the exact amount that Bill Gates and Donald Trump get every month in “5G Cash”…</p>
                <p>I have no doubt, it is growing too. </p>
                <p><strong><u>Because that is the law.</u></strong></p>
                <p>And just as it happens with them…</p>
                <p>The amount of YOUR “5G Cash” will entirely depend on you.</p>
                <p>But listen… </p>
                <p>Right now, it’s all about getting started, and collecting your first instalment of “5G Cash”…</p>

            <div class="row small-12 column">
                <p>Time is of the essence here. </p>
                <p>Millions of dollars have been paid out since the first “5G” were issued.</p>
                <p>And those who started early in this plan have noticed a nice pattern.</p>
                <p><strong>The amount of money they started collecting keeps going up and up.</strong></p>
                <p>In fact, over the last four years, the payouts from “5G Cash” has gone up on average by 57%.</p>
                <p>Which means, if you were collecting $1,600 per month in“5G Cash” four years ago, today you could be collecting $2,512
                    per month.</p>
                <p>Without changing a thing…</p>
                <p>You’d pocket an addition $10,994 in “free money” per year. </p>
                <p>So if 5G keeps growing like President Trump and I believe it will…</p>
                <p>You could look forward to returns increasing every year from here on out.</p>

                <p>You see there is a reason why 5G has become such a huge opportunity in the past few years…and will continue to keep
                    growing.</p>
                <p>In one word – DATA.</p>
                <p>Data is exploding like never before.</p>
                <p>Facebook, Uber, Instagram, and all the other apps on your phone are generating hundreds of thousands of gigabyte of
                    data by the minute…</p>
                <p>Video streaming…</p>
                <p>Web hosting…</p>
                <p>Self-driving cars…</p>
                <p>And as we move into the 2020s, other gadgets – fridges, cameras, and even the clothes we wear will start generating
                    data. </p>
                <p>By 2025, there will be over 175 TRILLION gigabytes.</p>
                <p>If all that data were stored in Blu-ray discs and the discs were placed on top of the other… the stack would reach
                    from the earth to the moon… <strong>23 TIMES.</strong></p>
                <p>All that data has to be stored somewhere.</p>
                <p>Enter “The cloud”</p>
                <p>You might know that “the cloud” is where big companies like Oracle, Amazon and Microsoft store data.</p>
                <p>What you may not know is that this “cloud” is not in the sky.</p>
                <p>It is right here on earth in massive buildings called data centers.</p>
                <p><strong>And guess what? </strong></p>
                <p><strong>The companies which own those data centers are using the very same <u>public law PL 86-779</u> to save on taxes as the cell tower companies.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Which means they too must pay out up to 90% of their taxable income to regular Americans.</strong></p>
                <p>And Americans who know about this are quietly collecting what I call “Big Data Payouts”. </p>
                <p>Karl.S, a graduate from University of New Hampshire gets back <strong>$1553.90</strong> in the form of “Big Data
                    Payouts”, every month</p>
                <p><em>(graphic)</em></p>
                <p>50 Year old Edward B, gets back “Big Data Payouts” worth $<strong>556.40</strong> every month</p>
                <p><em>(graphic)</em></p>
                <p>Simon M, a 46-year old accountant gets a tidy <strong>$1408.75</strong> every month via “Big Data Payouts.” </p>
                <p><em>(graphic)</em></p>
                <p>But the payouts can be a lot bigger as you can see in the case of Brandi G. who goes laughing to the bank to deposit
                    her “Big Data Payout” worth a whopping <strong>$13,524</strong> every month </p>
                <p><em>(graphic)</em></p>
                <p>Listen, even you deserve to get these payouts… </p>
            </div>
            <h2><strong>Companies have been profiting off your data for decades. It’s time they paid you back.</strong></h2>
            <div class="triangle-down"></div>
            <div class="row small-12 column">
                <p>A big part of the reason why the demand for data centers is growing so much is because private companies gather more
                    information about their customers than ever before.</p>
                <p>Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and many other companies are making off like bandits with your data- and you’re not
                    making a dime off it.</p>
                <p><strong>But here’s the good news? </strong></p>
                <p><strong>All those companies are paying rent to the data centers to store your data.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>And these data center companies are required to pay out up to 90% of their income to Americans like
                        you.</strong></p>
                <p>[insert partial calendar image]<em> (graphic)</em></p>
                <p>Around Dec 26, the next round of “Big Data Payouts” will be sent out to savvy investors.</p>
                <p>And you can be one of them.</p>
                <p>Many of them are regularly receiving payouts of <strong>$556, $1553, $2,681</strong> and even <strong>$7,535</strong>
                    <em><u>every month</u></em> </p>
                <p>In the 5G era, it’s quite likely that those payouts will grow significantly.</p>
                <p>I want you to make the most of this easy income opportunity. </p>
                <p>I’ve put everything in this bonus research report called <strong><em>Big Data Payouts: Your Never Ending Source of
                            Income from the internet</em></strong></p>
                <p>[insert cover image for “Big Data Payouts” here]<em> (graphic)</em></p>
                <p>Normally, research like this is valued at $495, which is a mere fraction of the income you could generate from ““Big
                    Data Payouts.”</p>
                <p>But the great thing is you won’t be charged a penny for either the pass code for the <strong><em>5G Cash Command
                            Center (5GCC)</em></strong> or for my research report, <strong><em>Big Data Payouts: Your Never Ending Source of
                            Income from the internet </em></strong></p>

                <p>There’s something even bigger I’ve been holding back. </p>
                <p>You see, while I’m super- excited about the “5G Cash” and the Big Data Payouts coming your way…</p>
                <p>There are other income opportunities too that I’d like you to cash-in on in the coming year.</p>

                            just as good when that money hits your account!)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Getting an extra 2% contribution match on your 401(k) from your broker with NO extra work on your

                    <li><strong>Boosting the value of blue chip stock holdings by 20% or more with a strange investment method from the

                    priceless.</p>
                <p>Add the valuable bonuses and it becomes an even better deal. </p>
                <p>At a conservative estimate, all those bonuses would cost you (if you can buy them) anywhere between $1499 and $1699.
                </p>
                <p>But as this is about building a long-term relationship, I want to start with my best foot forward.</p>
                <p>So we will not be charging anywhere close to $1700</p>
                <p>In fact, we will not even charge you $1000</p>
                <p>Or $500</p>
                <p>Or even $100.</p>
                <p>In the past, we charged our readers $99 per year… but you will not have to pay even that. </p>
                <p>Considering the amount of cash you could soon be pocketing from just “5G Cash”, I think you’d agree that $99 is a
                    heck of a bargain on its own.</p>
                <p>And that doesn’t include the countless other income secrets I’m going to give you the moment you join us.</p>

            <p><strong>P.S.</strong> Still have questions? No problem. In fact, it’s good. It shows that you care about your money.Which is a first step in growing your income.</p>
            <p>Here are the questions coming up most often when people first hear about “5G Cash”:</p>
            <div class="qa-container">
                <div class="question">
                    <p><strong>Q:</strong> </p>
                    <p><strong>This 5G Cash sound incredible. Why are these companies giving away this money?</strong>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p><strong>A:</strong></p>
                    <p> It’s a great question. These companies get tons of tax-free benefits when they send out “5G
                        Cash.” </p>
                    <p>There is big money involved here. </p>
                    <p>The way this whole thing is structured, neither are you doing the companies a favor. Nor are the companies doing you
                        a favor. </p>
                    <p>The best part? </p>
                    <p>Because more money actually flows into these companies, they get to expand their operations, and as a result, your
                        “5G Cash” account could see even MORE money flowing in. </p>
                    <p>This is one of those rare occasions where everybody can benefit. You might have heard of Win-Win. Well, this is the
                        closest it comes to Win-Win. </p>

                    <p><strong>Q: </strong> </p>
                    <p><strong>I’ve never trusted big companies. What if they try and get the better of me after I
                            join.</strong></p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>A:</p>
                    <p>These companies come under SEC Rulings. </p>
                    <p>They are forced by LAW to pay you your share of the profits. If they don’t the consequences can be very dire (for the
                        companies). </p>
                    <p>The SEC takes these things very seriously and the companies are audited at random to ensure no under-hand dealings
                        take place. </p>
                    <p>So please do not worry about your investment. As long as we don’t go back to a time when there are no smart phones…,
